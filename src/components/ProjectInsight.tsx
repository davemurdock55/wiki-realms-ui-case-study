          During our research, testing, and interviewing process, we learned that writing, and by extension worldbuilding, is a process that is unique to every individual. Itâ€™s a creative process
          where people come up with ideas, expand on them, and connect them in different ways into interesting and intriguing concepts that they can inspire others with. Writers, and worldbuilders in
          general, need to be able to work on both the big picture of their work, tying together the overall themes and making sure their broad strokes come together cohesively, while also being able
          to zoom in and focus on masterfully tweaking the minute details that will bring their world to life as well as breathe character into the diverse cultures, backdrops, and characters in their
          work.

          Our task was to take this feedback and transform it into an app with features that have rarely been seen in any other existing applications. In addition, we also had to balance keeping the
          app simple while still allowing for complexity to leverage the power of the app to help writers worldbuild.
